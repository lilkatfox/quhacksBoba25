  <main><p>Boba, also known as bubble tea, has become a beloved beverage worldwide, known for its unique taste and texture. 
    Originating in Taiwan in the 1980s, boba typically consists of a base tea, often milk tea or fruit tea, combined with 
    chewy tapioca pearls and sweetened with sugar or flavored syrups. There are various types of boba, ranging from 
    classic milk tea with tapioca pearls to more adventurous flavors like taro, matcha, or even coffee-based options. 
    Some variations include fruit teas with fresh fruit chunks or jelly toppings. Boba can also be customized with 
    different sweetness levels and types of milk. Its popularity has led to a diverse array of boba shops and cafes 
    worldwide, each offering their own twist on this delightful and refreshing beverage. My personal favorite is the 
    classic dirty milk tea! Some of my favorite toppings include:</p>
